Write a Python function is_palindrome(s) that checks if a given string s is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backwards. Implement the solution using a stack.

 

Note: Use the functions pop() and append() in the logic.
