Write a Python function called divide_numbers that takes two numbers as input parameters and returns the result of dividing the first number by the second number. However, your function should handle the following scenarios gracefully:

If either of the input parameters is not a number, the function should raise a TypeError with an appropriate error message.
If the second number is zero, the function should raise a ZeroDivisionError with an appropriate error message.
If the division operation encounters any other unexpected error, the function should catch it and print "An unexpected error occurred" along with the error message.
NOTE: Use the raise keyword for the exception output.

Your task is to implement the divide_numbers function according to the requirements mentioned above.
