Write a Python function called filter_numbers that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list. Additionally, the function should print a message indicating whether the length of the resulting list is greater than, equal to, or less than 5.

Note:

   Try using the if statement, for loop and take list input for the program. You are free to use any Python environment including notebooks.

Sample input:

   input_numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
