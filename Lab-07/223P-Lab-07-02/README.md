<!-- You are tasked with creating a simple Python program that reads data from a file, performs basic operations on the data, and then writes the modified data back to another file. Implement the following functionalities:

Read data from an input file called "input_data.txt". Each line in the file contains an integer.
Calculate the sum of all the integers read from the file.
Write the sum to an output file called "output_result.txt".
Write the logic within a single function definition, no need to create multiple functions. Feel free to brainstorm with classmates.

Make sure to use the 'with' keyword for file definition. -->
