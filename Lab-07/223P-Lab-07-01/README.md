<!-- Develop a simple program to display information about students. The program should take student details as input (name, age, grade, address, phone) and format them in a specified way.

Implement the following functionalities using string formatting:

Use the str.format() method to format and display the student's name, age, and grade.
Manually format the student's address using string slicing and concatenation.
Utilize string methods to pad the student's phone number to a given column width (use unique special characters to properly visualize the padding).
Write all the logic within a single function definition. Feel free to brainstorm with classmates and come up with unique solutions. -->
