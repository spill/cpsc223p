Create a Python module math_operations that includes the following functions:

add: Takes two numbers as parameters and returns their sum.
subtract: Takes two numbers as parameters and returns the result of subtracting the second number from the first.
Refer to the below pseudocode.

# math_operations.py

def add(x, y): return x + y

def subtract(x, y): return x - y

Write a separate Python script main_script.py that imports the math_operations module and uses these functions to perform operations on two numbers provided by the user.

When you run main_script.py, it will import the math_operations module and use its functions to perform basic mathematical operations on two user input numbers.
