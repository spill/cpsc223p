# Create a Python module named calculator with the following functions:

# multiply: Takes two numbers as parameters and prints their multiplication.
# divide: Takes two numbers as parameters and prints their division.
# Additionally, modify the calculator module so that when it is executed as a script (not imported), it calls the multiply and divide functions with predefined values.

# NOTE:

# # Check if the module is executed as a script using if __name__ == "__main__":
