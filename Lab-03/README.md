Write a Python function called expense_calculation that calculates the total expense for a trip. The function should take three parameters:

hotel_cost (default value of 0)
food_cost (default value of 0)
entertainment_cost (default value of 0)
Also, the function should accept a keyword argument extra_expenses (default value of 0) that represents any additional expenses beyond the standard ones.

The function should return the total expense, which is the sum of hotel_cost, food_cost, entertainment_cost, and extra_expenses.

 

Note: Please submit the .py, .ipynb or a screenshot of the working code along with the output.
